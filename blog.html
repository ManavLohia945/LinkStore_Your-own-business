                <p>Wearing Alexander Calder’s jewelry to a party once marked a woman as an art world insider. “It was a something of a cult to wear Calder’s jewelry in the thirties and forties,” says Mark Rosenthal, who helped curate the exhibit Calder Jewelry in 2008.

                    It didn’t cost much to wear this hipster badge. Marion Willard sold Calder’s jewelry in her midtown Manhattan gallery for $5 to $25 a piece. Similar pieces now sell for $150,000 to $500,000.
                    
                    Calder began making jewelry for his sister’s dolls at age 6 and, for the rest of his life, carried pliers and bits of wire in his pockets. As he once put it: “I think best in wire.”
                    
                    Making jewelry became a way for Calder to work out ideas for large-scale pieces and support his family while he got established as a sculptor. The first time his jewelry was exhibited, in 1929, it was right beside his paintings and sculpture.

                <p>Diversity isn’t just a buzz word; it’s a business policy that pays off. 
                    According to an article from Entrepreneur, diversity helps attract more talent, 
                    different experiences lead to more innovation, diverse thoughts increase customer satisfaction, and a 
                    diverse team resonates with customers and investors. Diversity doesn’t usually happen by accident; you
                     have to strive for it. While quotas may not be the way to go (e.g., mandating that a 
                    certain percentage of the staff be women), keeping an open mind in hiring and promotion can create
                     diversity.</p>

                     like you’ll never get enough bookings for the fall? I know several independent professionals who feel
